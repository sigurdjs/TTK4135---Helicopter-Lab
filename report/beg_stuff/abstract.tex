\begin{abstract}
In the helicopter lab for TTK4135 Optimization and Control, different optimal control algorithms have been tested out on a physical model helicopter. The lab has enabled the group to develop optimal control sequences using the physical characteristics of the helicopter together with a set of constraints for each problem.

A linear mathematical model for the helicopter is derived, discretized and used to find optimal trajectories for the helicopter in one and two degrees of freedom. The helicopter is tested with trajectories involving both linear and non-linear constraints. Results show that to follow the trajectories correctly, state feedback has to be included.
