\section{Introduction}

In this lab assigment we have attemped to control a table mounted helicopter with different methods of regulation. The helicopter is made up of a moveable arm with two rotors attached. We aimed to control both the travel, pitch and elevation of the helicopter.

In the first part of the report the basic mathematical model of the system is presented and an optimal control sequence for travel and pitch with linear constraints is implemented. Then a linear quadratic state feedback controller is introduced to better track the optimal trajectory calculated in the first part. In the last part a non-linear constraint is included in the problem and an optimal trajectory for both pitch, travel and elevation is calculated. The resulting sequence is tested on the lab helicopter with and without the LQ-controller. Results are attatched and discussed accordingly for each problem.
